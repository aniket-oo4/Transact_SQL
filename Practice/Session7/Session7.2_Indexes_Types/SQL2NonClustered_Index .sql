--Non-clustered Index   -- it does not changes main table ie sorts 
create nonclustered index idx_tblEmployee_DateOfBirth on [dbo].[tblEmployee]([DateOfBirth])

-- you can create primar key ,custered ,non clustered indexes on more than 1  column 
create nonclustered index idx_tblEmployee_DateOfBirth_Department on [dbo].[tblEmployee]([DateOfBirth],Department)

drop index idx_tblEmployee on [dbo].[tblEmployee]

select * from [dbo].[tblEmployee2] where [EmployeeNumber] = 127
select * from [dbo].[tblEmployee2]

select DateOfBirth, Department
from [dbo].[tblEmployee]
where DateOfBirth>='1992-01-01' and DateOfBirth<'1993-01-01'
